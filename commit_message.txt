feat: Enhanced LogonUser Response Display and Session Management

## Major Features Added

### 🎨 LogonUser Response Body Enhancement
- **JSON Formatting**: Added intelligent JSON parsing and pretty-printing with 2-space indentation
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-coded JSON elements (keys, strings, numbers, booleans, null values)
- **Smart Fallback**: Displays plain text when response is not valid JSON
- **Download Functionality**: Added "💾 Download JSON" button for each logonUser response
  - Enhanced metadata includes capture timestamp, URL, and source information
  - Timestamped filenames: `logonUser-response-[ISO-timestamp].json`
  - Structured JSON with metadata wrapper for better organization

### 🔄 Session Management Improvements
- **Enhanced Data Hash**: Improved session change detection to include logonUser captures
- **Session Change Detection**: Added forced refresh when session ID changes
- **Periodic Auto-Refresh**: Implemented 2-second interval refresh for real-time updates
- **Better Caching Logic**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders while ensuring data freshness

### 🧹 UI/UX Cleanup
- **Removed Redundant Information**: Eliminated duplicate Session ID, Workstation ID, and FI Number from individual requests
  - These details now only appear in Session Summary where they belong
  - Cleaner individual request display focusing on per-request metrics
- **Enhanced Request Context**: Added detailed context for logonUser requests showing:
  - Request source (webRequest API vs inject.js capture)
  - WebSocket parameters (ws25, etc.)
  - Request timestamp
  - Response capture status

### 🐛 Debug and Analysis Tools
- **Advanced LogonUser Debugging**: Comprehensive logging system for duplicate detection
  - Tracks all logonUser requests with source attribution
  - Detects potential duplicates by URL pattern
  - Detailed request lifecycle tracking
- **Session Transition Logging**: Enhanced logging for session changes and data updates
- **Request Source Identification**: Clear distinction between different capture methods

## Technical Improvements

### 📊 Data Processing
- **Smart Request Grouping**: Improved filtering logic to handle both regular and logonUser requests
- **Enhanced Hash Function**: Better change detection including session ID and request counts
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Logic to identify and warn about potential duplicate requests

### 🎨 Styling Enhancements
- **JSON Syntax Colors**: Added CSS classes for JSON element highlighting
  - `.json-key`: Blue (#0066cc) for object keys
  - `.json-string`: Green (#009900) for string values  
  - `.json-number`: Orange (#cc6600) for numeric values
  - `.json-boolean`: Purple (#990099) for true/false
  - `.json-null`: Gray (#999999) for null values
- **Download Button Styling**: Teal download buttons with hover effects
- **Responsive Header Layout**: Flex layout for response body headers with download buttons

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Refresh**: Only updates when actual data changes detected
- **Session-Aware Caching**: Clears cache on session transitions for accurate display
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of refresh intervals on popup close

## User Experience Improvements

### 🔍 Better Request Analysis
- **Context-Aware Display**: LogonUser requests now show meaningful context information
- **Source Attribution**: Clear indication whether request was detected vs response captured
- **Timeline Information**: Request timestamps for better debugging workflow

### 📁 Data Export Enhancement
- **Structured Downloads**: JSON files include comprehensive metadata
- **Professional Formatting**: Clean, readable JSON output with proper indentation
- **Debugging-Ready**: Downloaded files contain all necessary context for analysis

### 🔄 Real-Time Updates
- **Automatic Refresh**: Popup stays current without manual intervention
- **Session Awareness**: Immediately updates when user logs in/out or changes sessions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Maintains UI state while updating data intelligently

## Debug and Development Features

### 🐛 Enhanced Logging
- Comprehensive request tracking with source identification
- Duplicate detection warnings for troubleshooting
- Session change notifications for debugging authentication flows
- Request lifecycle tracking from detection through display

### 🔬 Analysis Tools
- Multiple logonUser request analysis with categorization
- Request source attribution (webRequest API vs page context injection)
- Timeline analysis for authentication flow debugging
- Response body structure validation and formatting

This commit significantly improves the logonUser capture system's usability, reliability, and debugging capabilities while streamlining the UI for better user experience.
