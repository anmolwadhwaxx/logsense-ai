## How It Works

The extension operates through a coordinated system of components:

### 1. **Background Service Worker**
- `background.js` uses Chrome’s `webRequest` API to capture:
  - Request/response headers
  - Timestamps
  - Status codes
- Stores request data and provides it to the popup or content scripts.

### 2. **Popup Interface**

- `popup.html`, `popup.js`, and `popup.css` power the extension UI.
- Shows a list of captured network requests and environment metadata.
- Generates Alexandria log search URLs for HQ, LightBridge, Kamino, and Ardent platforms.
- Features enhanced UI with color-coded interactive log buttons for easy platform identification.
- Improved text wrapping and collapsible environment info section for better usability.
- Responsive flexbox layout that adapts to different popup sizes.
- Includes User Info section and download functionality for future enhancements.

### 3. **Content Script**
- `content.js` injects a floating button into pages.
- Communicates with `inject.js` (which runs in the page context) to access global JS variables and cookies (like `Ngam`, `Q2_CONFIG`, etc.).
- Collects UUX environment details and forwards them to the popup and background.

### 4. **Script Injection**
- `inject.js` runs in the page’s JS context.
- Extracts UUX-specific metadata like:
  - UUX version
  - Theme
  - Language
  - CDN base URL
  - Platform/SDK version
- Sends data back via `window.postMessage`.

## Required Permissions

```json
"permissions": [
  "tabs",
  "storage",
  "cookies",
  "scripting",
  "activeTab",
  "webRequest"
],
"host_permissions": [
  "<all_urls>"
]
```
These permissions are necessary to monitor network traffic, read cookies, and interact with the current tab.

---

## Alexandria Log URLs

For each captured request, URLs are generated for multiple Alexandria log platforms:

### HQ Logs

    https://alexandria.shs.aws.q2e.io/logs/<SEARCH_STRING>

### LightBridge Logs

    https://alexandria.shs.aws.q2e.io/logs/<LIGHTBRIDGE_SEARCH_STRING>

### Kamino Logs

    https://alexandria.shs.aws.q2e.io/logs/<KAMINO_SEARCH_STRING>

### Ardent Logs

    https://alexandria.shs.aws.q2e.io/logs/<ARDENT_SEARCH_STRING>

Search strings are automatically generated with the following format:

**HQ & Kamino (Session-based):**

    search index="app_logs_{prod/stage}_{hq/kamino}" sessionId="..." earliest="..." latest="..." | fields * | extract | sort timestamp, seqId | head 10000

**LightBridge & Ardent (Workstation-based):**

    search index="app_logs_{prod/stage}_{lightbridge/ardent}" workstationId="..." earliest="..." latest="..." | fields * | extract | sort timestamp, seqId | head 10000

**Note:** Ardent logs use a 15-minute time window (`earliest="-15m"`) instead of the 30-minute window used by other platforms.

This enables comprehensive log lookup across all Q2 platforms for debugging user sessions.

## Development Notes

- `utils/har.js` includes functions to format request/response data into HAR format (can be extended for HAR export).
- `popup.js` has helper functions to extract, format, and render network request metadata with support for multiple log platforms.
- Content and popup scripts use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` for cross-context communication.
- The UI includes a collapsible panel for viewing environment info in detail with enhanced styling.
- Enhanced CSS styling provides better text wrapping and improved readability for long URLs and text content.
- Color-coded log buttons provide intuitive access to different Alexandria platforms:
  - HQ Logs: Blue (#007BFF)
  - LightBridge Logs: Green (#28A745)
  - Kamino Logs: Gray (#6C757D)
  - Ardent Logs: Red (#DC3545)
- Responsive button layout adapts to different popup sizes with flexbox design.
